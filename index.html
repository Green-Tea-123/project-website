        <h2> 1. An Introduction To MIC@Home </h2>
        <video-component tag="intro" source="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v=a5UuXfUBgXM" 
          subtitle="Video: An introduction to MIC@Home"></video-component>
        <p>
          The Mobile Inpatient Care @ Home (MIC@Home) initiative, launched by the Ministry of Health (MOH) through the MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT), aims to offer eligible patients the option of receiving inpatient-level care in their own homes rather than in a hospital ward. The program was designed to alleviate the growing strain on hospital bed capacity in Singapore, which is particularly relevant in light of the aging population and increasing healthcare demands.
          <br><br>
          Since its pilot in 2022, the program has proven successful in improving patient satisfaction, reducing hospital-acquired infections, and lowering the length of hospital stays, while still providing care equivalent to what patients would receive in a hospital setting. By 2023, over 2,000 patients had benefited from MIC@Home, saving around 9,000 hospital bed days (<i>Singapore's Public Hospital Bed Crunch: Are Radical Solutions Needed?</i>, 2023). 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-1">
        <h3>1.1. Moving Care To The Home</h3>
        <p>
          The MIC@Home model allows patients with a range of conditions, including skin infections, urinary tract infections, and congestive heart failure, to receive care in the comfort of their own homes (Figure 1). Patients in this program receive hospital-level care at home, including vital sign monitoring, intravenous treatments, and blood tests, delivered by a combination of teleconsultations and home visits by a dedicated team of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals.
        </p>

        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/mic_intro.png"
          subtitle="Figure 1: Overview of MIC@home">
        </image-component>

        <p>
          One of the primary benefits of MIC@Home is the remote monitoring of patient conditions. This allows healthcare teams to track patients' progress, and in cases of deterioration, emergency medical services can be activated, ensuring that the patient is provided immediate care, without the need for an inpatient stay. The initiative also allows patients to avoid the risks of hospital-acquired infections, further enhancing their recovery experience.
          <br><br>
          In line with the government's five-year plan to add 1,900 beds to the public healthcare system by 2026, MIC@Home serves as a critical tool in managing hospital bed shortages while maintaining high standards of care (<i>DELIVERING CARE BEYOND HOSPITALS</i>, 2024). The program is expected to increase the number of virtual beds to 300 by the end of 2024.
        </p>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-2">
        <h3>1.2. Key Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>
          The success of MIC@Home relies on the collaboration of several key stakeholders, each of whom plays a critical role in ensuring that patients receive the necessary care at home.

        <h2>2. Problem Identification</h2>
        <p>
          With no initial problem statement provided by MOHT, our task began by identifying gaps and challenges within the MIC@Home model. Through in-depth interviews with MIC@Home nurses and discussions with the MOHT team, we examined patient and nurse journeys to identify specific pain points, limitations, and unmet needs (Appendix 1). This section outlines these insights and the resulting problem statements that will drive our approach to enhancing home-based patient care.

      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-2-header-1-1">
        <h4>2.1.1. Patients' User Journey</h4>
        <p>
          To better understand the experiences of patients within the MIC@Home program, a user journey map was developed (Appendix 2).
          <br><br>

          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/patient_journey_map.png"
          subtitle="Figure 2: Patient journey map with identified pain points">
          </image-component>
          <br><br>

          In the Before Daily Visits phase, patients are responsible for managing their health independently. This involves monitoring vital signs such as blood pressure, temperature, heart rate and SPO2 using the medical devices provided by the hospital (Figure 3). They must then document these readings by writing them down and taking pictures of the notes, which are subsequently sent to the healthcare team via WhatsApp. Pain points in this phase include anxiety about recovery progress, as patients may be uncertain whether they are improving or if their health is stable. Additionally, there is uncertainty about the accuracy of vital sign measurements, as patients may not feel confident in using the devices correctly, leading to doubts about the reliability of their readings.
          <br><br>

          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/patient_recordings.png"
          subtitle="Figure 3: A patient enrolled in the MIC@Home program using monitoring equipment and manually recording vitals">
          </image-component>
          <br><br>

          During daily visits, healthcare providers check in on the patient's condition and assess their progress. One common pain point here is forgetting the medication schedule; patients may struggle to remember when to take their medications, which could lead to missed doses.
          <br><br>

          After the healthcare provider leaves, patients continue to monitor their health independently. One of the main pain points in this phase is difficulty remembering the instructions provided by the healthcare team. Since patients have to rely on manual methods of logging data, the process can feel cumbersome, and there’s a risk of missing important steps in their care plan. Another pain point is physical or emotional discomfort during or after medical exams, which can make patients feel overwhelmed or stressed.
          <br><br>

          During the recovery process, patients often feel disconnected from the healthcare team once the daily visits end. A key pain point is the lack of clarity around diagnosis and care plans, which leads to uncertainty about the recovery process. Additionally, patients experience feelings of emotional isolation, especially when they are left to manage their health without daily interaction with a healthcare provider.

          </table>
          <br><br>

          This highlights three main challenges that need to be addressed in order to improve the patient experience within the MIC@Home program. The solution should focus on simplifying medication management to reduce confusion and anxiety, addressing the communication gaps by improving access to healthcare providers for timely clarifications, and providing timely feedback on logged vitals to help patients track their recovery progress.

        <h4>2.1.4. Problem Statement (Patients)</h4>
        <p>
          Our exploration of user journeys, patient interviews, and identified pain points led to a clear problem statement:
          <br><br>

          Patients recovering at home need a supportive way to monitor their health, receive personalized feedback, and stay connected to their healthcare team because they often feel isolated and anxious without clear guidance and real-time insights into their condition. This lack of support diminishes their confidence in the recovery process and hinders their ability to actively engage in their own health journey.

        <h4>2.2.1. Nurses' User Journey</h4>
        <p>
          To gain a deeper understanding of the experiences of nurses within the MIC@Home program, a user journey map was created (Appendix 2).
          <br><br>

          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/nurse_journey_map.png"
          subtitle="Figure 6: Nurse journey map with identified pain points">
          </image-component>
          <br><br>

          The journey begins with the Before Daily Visits phase, where nurses prepare by reviewing patient records, checking for updates from other healthcare professionals, and ensuring they have the necessary equipment and medications for the visit. This phase is vital for setting up effective care, but nurses often face challenges such as managing large amounts of patient data and ensuring its accuracy. These issues can delay preparations and potentially hinder timely care delivery.
          <br><br>

          In the During Daily Visits phase, nurses assess patient conditions, administer treatments, and engage with patients and their families. Time constraints are a major issue in this phase, as nurses are expected to provide comprehensive care within limited timeframes. This pressure can make it difficult for nurses to fully understand a patient’s condition or address all of their concerns. The emotional demands of providing care, especially to patients who may feel isolated or anxious, add another layer of complexity.
          <br><br>

          Following the visit, nurses enter the Post-Visit Documentation phase, where they update patient records and adjust care plans based on their findings. The challenge here is the pressure to complete documentation quickly while managing other responsibilities. The sheer volume of paperwork can lead to missed details, which may affect the quality of patient care. Furthermore, the need to rely on informal communication channels, such as WhatsApp, to share information with other healthcare professionals increases the risk of miscommunication, which can have significant consequences on patient care. Nurses also report the additional burden of maintaining hardcopy records, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.
          <br><br>

          The Collaboration and Communication phase is essential as nurses must communicate with other healthcare team members to ensure seamless care. However, gaps in communication and incomplete handovers between teams or shifts can leave nurses with fragmented information, making it harder to make informed decisions and maintain continuity of care.

        <h4>2.2.2. Current Limitations (Nurses)</h4>
        <p>
          Based on insights gathered from interviews and user journey maps, three key limitations were identified for nurses within the MIC@Home program:

          <table style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
            <caption><i>Table 2. Key Challenges and Limitations (Nurses)</i></caption>
            <tr>

              <th>Nurse's Insights</th>
              <th>Identified Limitations</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>“I’m juggling so many tasks during the visit that keeping up with documentation feels impossible. I worry about forgetting important details later on in the case notes.”</td>
              <td>Nurses <b>face challenges in keeping up with documentation</b> alongside multiple tasks, risking missed details in case notes, impacting patient care quality and increasing their stress.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>“With the limited time I have with my patients, I can’t get a full picture of their conditions, which makes it hard to give them holistic care. I feel like I’m missing key details that could make a difference.”</td>
              <td>Limited patient interaction time <b>hinders nurses from fully understanding patient conditions</b>, affecting their ability to provide holistic care and potentially missing critical health aspects.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>“With so many teams taking different shifts, I’m not always clear on a patient’s situation as keeping up updates between teams is tough, and I often feel out of the loop on important patient details.”</td>
              <td>Frequent handovers and <b>fragmented communication create gaps</b>, leaving nurses out of the loop on crucial patient information.</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br><br>

          The primary challenges faced by nurses in the MIC@Home program include managing extensive patient data, navigating time constraints during home visits, and overcoming communication gaps between healthcare teams. To address these issues, solutions should focus on streamlining data management, enhancing time management capabilities, and improving communication channels to ensure seamless care coordination and support nurses in delivering efficient and high-quality patient care.
